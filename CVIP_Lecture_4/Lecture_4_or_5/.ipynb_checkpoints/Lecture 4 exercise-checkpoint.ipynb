    "## The Case of the Incompetent Prince\n",
    "Every year, the kingdoms of Unbelievablia hold a royal tournament to keep the peace.\n",
    "In this tournament is a series of games, including:\n",
    "* [thwarting the mole infestation](https://www.classicgame.com/game/Whack+a+Mole)\n",
    "* [taking down a hoard of enemies](https://poki.com/en/g/gun-fu-stickman-2)\n",
    "* [surviving the robot apocalypse](https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/robot-invasion)\n",
    "* [killing the thieving rats](https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/tap-the-rat)\n",
    "* [barefoot lumberjacking](https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/kick-ya-chop)\n",
    "* [rounding up the herd](https://www.addictinggames.com/clicker/pet-round-up)\n",
    "* a game of the prince's choosing (this just means you can choose to do this for another game, instead of the listed ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, the prince of HellNah participated in the mole infestation game and won...by a lot! After such an impressive feat, even more people have travelled to HellNah to see him play this year's games.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to show that he's not a one-trick pony, he'll have to prove himself in one of the other games. \n",
    "Unfortunately, his reflexes tend more towards those of a caterpiller than of a cat. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, how did he win last time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the royal poisoner (yes, that's you) made him a potion tailored specifically for the mole games *see code below*. It is therefore, once again, up to you, to devise one for one of the other games, and save the day!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PS: He can also show skill by [playing the piano](https://www.crazygames.com/t/piano) really fast, but that requires a weaker potion (i.e. can be done using color detection instead of template matching), and is therefore unlikely to carry as much favour with the crowds.\n",
